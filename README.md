## What is this thing?

My attempt at an open-source decentralized messaging program that's a bit more powerful than the rest.


## Why is the Curl codebase such a nightmare?
### (Also: "Why are the UI, auth providers, and Block Managers all broken up?) 

I though that seperating the UI, authentication, and communication was a good idea. I doubt it will get any less divvied up once blocks need to start handling voice, video, and other funâ„¢ things

## Why not just call it a "Server" like everyone else?

"Buildings" and "Offices" literally can't be ambiguous
